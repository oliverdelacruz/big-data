This is useful, for example, if you don't have time to finish this exercise in one sitting: you can just delete your cluster, recreate it later, and continue your work. Azure storage is selected by default (see the screenshot). In \"Select a Storage Account\" click \"Create new\" and specify a name. **Important: if you are recreating your HBase cluster and want to see the existing data, then choose \"Select existing\" and set the container name to the one that you see in the \"Storage Accounts\" tab of Azure&mdash;by default Azure generates a new container name every time you create a cluster, which then points to a different container.** Leave everything else as it is and click \"Next\".\n",

So, if for applying a filter to the author column we also have to load the full text of the article (as is the case with just one column family), the operation will take longer than if we don't have to (as is the case with a separate column family for the article text and for metadata).\n",
